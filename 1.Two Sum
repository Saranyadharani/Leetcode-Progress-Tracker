ty listGiven an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        dict_no={}
        for i in range (len(nums)):
            num=nums[i]
            complement=target-num
            if complement in dict_no:
                print(dict_no[complement],i)
            dict_no[num]=i
        return[]

MY SOLUTION:
  TO CREATE A DICTIONARY A ASSIGNING A KEY-VALUE FOR EACH VALUE IN THE ARRAY NUMS ONE BY ONE AND CALCULATING THE COMPLMENTARY(TARGET-NUM(current num indexed in the dictionary)) and continue this process until the compemetary value is already present in the dictionary if presen return the indices of the 2 no else return 0
